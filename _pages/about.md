My name is Juan Jose Chong, and I currently work at Analog Devices as an Applications Engineer with a focus on MEMS-based Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). In this role, I work directly with customers to help them integrate and debug any mechanical or electrical concerns they may run into when using inertial sensors. My previous role as a Senior Product Engineer in the inertial sensing group allowed me to become an expert in calibrating, testing and implementing high-performance inertial measurement units (IMUs). 

In my free time, I volunteer with FIRST robotics by volunteering as a FIRST Technical Advisor (FTA) at events across the country (and sometimes internationally). I also work with a local robotics team FRC 900, The Zebracorns ([link](https://team900.org/)) where possible to help develop ROS-based robot code.
